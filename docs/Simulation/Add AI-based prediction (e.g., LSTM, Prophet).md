# 📘 Water Hydraulic Pressures Simulation in Water Net Pipelines

This document outlines how to simulate hydraulic pressure in water pipe networks and build a complete system that overcomes the current limitations of tools like EPANET and WNTR. We'll build everything needed step-by-step, including live dashboards, real-time data pipelines, ML anomaly detection, multilingual metadata, graph-based querying, a real-time alerting engine, GIS map integration, Streamlit dashboards, exporting to Neo4j or RDF, automated optimization for pump scheduling, exporting results to PDF or Excel, and AI-based prediction.

## ✅ Project Goals
- Fully simulate water pressure and detect defective pipes.
- Enhance open tools (EPANET, WNTR) with real-time, intelligent capabilities.
- Build modular systems using Docker, PostgreSQL, Python, and Gremlin.
- Visualize data using HTML dashboards and graph UIs.
- Create multilingual, optimized, and extensible water network models.
- Receive real-time alerts for abnormal pressure values or leaks.
- Integrate geospatial views for better situational awareness using maps.
- Create intuitive Streamlit dashboards for non-technical users.
- Export data to graph databases or semantic web standards (Neo4j, RDF).
- Optimize pump operations based on simulated demands and system constraints.
- Generate sharable reports in PDF and Excel formats.
- Forecast future water demand and pressure using AI.

## 🧠 Step 12: AI-Based Prediction (LSTM / Prophet)

We now integrate predictive analytics using deep learning (LSTM) and classical models (Prophet) to forecast future water demand, pressure drops, or pump behavior.

### 📈 Using Facebook Prophet
```python
from prophet import Prophet
import pandas as pd

# Prepare dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({"ds": pd.date_range(start='2024-01-01', periods=100, freq='H'),
                   "y": pressure_series})  # your node pressure data here

model = Prophet()
model.fit(df)
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=48, freq='H')
forecast = model.predict(future)
model.plot(forecast)
```

### 🔮 Using LSTM for Deep Learning Forecast
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
import numpy as np

# Assume X_train, y_train are prepared as time-series pressure input/output
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50)
predicted = model.predict(X_test)
```

Forecasts can trigger alerts, guide pump schedules, or anticipate failures.
