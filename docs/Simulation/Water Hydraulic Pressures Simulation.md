# üìò Water Hydraulic Pressures Simulation in Water Net Pipelines

This document covers tools, setup steps, demo simulations, HTML integration, database schema, test data, and ongoing Q&A for simulating hydraulic pressure in water pipe networks. It supports defect detection and anomaly monitoring using EPANET, Python, PostgreSQL, and Gremlin-based Knowledge Graph visualization.

## ‚úÖ Purpose
- Simulate hydraulic pressure in water networks
- Detect defective or leaking pipelines based on pressure variations (high/low)
- Use open-source tools with PostgreSQL and Gremlin
- Build a Knowledge Graph of the water network
- Enable ML/AI-based analysis and real-time visual feedback
- Follow step-by-step simulations to trace pressure between stations and detect defective segments
- Fill in the missing pieces from WNTR/EPANET to create smarter simulations

## üß† What EPANET & WNTR Miss ‚Äî And How You Can Fill the Gaps
While EPANET and WNTR are powerful, here are areas where your own approach can enhance or complete the picture:

| Gap in EPANET/WNTR         | How to Fill It With Your Approach                                         |

## üíª HTML-Based Demo Simulation Using WNTR & Dash
Here is a simple example that loads a small `.inp` file, simulates pressure using WNTR, and visualizes results in an HTML dashboard using Dash.

```python
import wntr
import pandas as pd
import dash
from dash import dcc, html
import plotly.graph_objs as go

# Load example network
wn = wntr.network.WaterNetworkModel('data/Net3.inp')
sim = wntr.sim.EpanetSimulator(wn)
results = sim.run_sim()

# Extract pressure at a node over time
node = '123'  # replace with valid node in your INP
pressure = results.node['pressure'][node]

# Build HTML dashboard
app = dash.Dash(__name__)
app.layout = html.Div([
    html.H1('Pressure Simulation for Node 123'),
    dcc.Graph(
        figure=go.Figure(
            data=[go.Scatter(y=pressure.values, mode='lines', name='Pressure')],
            layout=go.Layout(title='Pressure vs Time', xaxis_title='Time Step', yaxis_title='Pressure (m)')
        )
    )
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

## üîó Are There Online Demos?
There is currently no official online demo hosted by EPA or WNTR, but you can:
- Run demos locally using Dash (see example above)
- Use GitHub projects like [WaterNetGen](https://github.com/alshedivat/WaterNetGen) to generate test data
- Deploy your Dash app to Render, Hugging Face Spaces, or Heroku

## ‚ùì Questions & Answers

### Q: Is there any Free Software like Petrel RE for Water Hydraulic Pressure?
**A:** Yes. EPANET is a public domain alternative developed by the US EPA for simulating water distribution and pressure.

### Q: I want to simulate pressure in pipelines and detect defects?
**A:** EPANET + WNTR (Python) is ideal. You can simulate pressure drops or leaks and flag unusual readings.

### Q: Can I connect EPANET results with a Knowledge Graph?
**A:** Yes. Use PostgreSQL to store simulation output, then query with Apache TinkerPop + Gremlin for graph modeling and visualization.

### Q: What is the best way to simulate water pressure?
**A:** Use EPANET for network modeling, WNTR for simulation and failure analysis, PostgreSQL for storage, and Gremlin/Dash Cytoscape for querying and visualization.

### Q: Can I see a demo of pressure simulation using HTML?
**A:** Yes! A Dash app is provided that shows pressure over time at a node using an interactive line chart.

### Q: Can I find defective pipes between multiple pressure stations?
**A:** Yes. By simulating pressure values at each station and comparing expected vs actual readings, you can identify abnormal pressure drops between nodes. These can be flagged using Python logic or Gremlin graph traversal.

### Q: What does EPANET and WNTR miss?
**A:** They lack real-time capabilities, multilingual support, dashboards, graph semantics, ML/AI modules, versioning, alerting, and optimization tools. These can all be added as extensions to build a smarter and more integrated system.
