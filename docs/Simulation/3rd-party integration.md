# 📘 Water Hydraulic Pressures Simulation in Water Net Pipelines

This document outlines how to simulate hydraulic pressure in water pipe networks and build a complete system that overcomes the current limitations of tools like EPANET and WNTR. We'll build everything needed step-by-step, including live dashboards, real-time data pipelines, ML anomaly detection, multilingual metadata, graph-based querying, a real-time alerting engine, GIS map integration, Streamlit dashboards, exporting to Neo4j or RDF, automated optimization for pump scheduling, exporting results to PDF or Excel, AI-based prediction, a multilingual public-facing web portal, metadata support using SHACL and DCAT, and REST/GraphQL APIs for third-party integration.

## ✅ Project Goals
- Fully simulate water pressure and detect defective pipes.
- Enhance open tools (EPANET, WNTR) with real-time, intelligent capabilities.
- Build modular systems using Docker, PostgreSQL, Python, and Gremlin.
- Visualize data using HTML dashboards and graph UIs.
- Create multilingual, optimized, and extensible water network models.
- Receive real-time alerts for abnormal pressure values or leaks.
- Integrate geospatial views for better situational awareness using maps.
- Create intuitive Streamlit dashboards for non-technical users.
- Export data to graph databases or semantic web standards (Neo4j, RDF).
- Optimize pump operations based on simulated demands and system constraints.
- Generate sharable reports in PDF and Excel formats.
- Forecast future water demand and pressure using AI.
- Build a multilingual and mobile-friendly public-facing web portal.
- Support metadata validation and semantic interoperability using SHACL and DCAT.
- Expose simulation, anomaly, and graph data via REST and GraphQL APIs.

## 📡 Step 15: REST & GraphQL APIs for 3rd-Party Integration

To support mobile apps, citizen portals, and smart city integrations, we expose REST and GraphQL APIs for querying:
- Pressure and flow measurements
- Simulation outputs
- Forecast results
- Metadata and historical anomalies

### ⚙️ FastAPI REST Example
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/pressure/{node_id}")
def get_pressure(node_id: str):
    conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=water user=postgres password=postgres")
    df = pd.read_sql(f"SELECT * FROM water_nodes WHERE node_id = '{node_id}'", conn)
    return df.to_dict(orient="records")[0]
```

### 🧠 GraphQL Example (Strawberry)
```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.fastapi import GraphQLRouter

@strawberry.type
class Node:
    node_id: str
    pressure: float

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def node(self, node_id: str) -> Node:
        return Node(node_id=node_id, pressure=73.5)

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)
graphql_app = GraphQLRouter(schema)
app.include_router(graphql_app, prefix="/graphql")
```

This provides flexible data access across clients (web, mobile, IoT) and enables advanced queries using GraphQL.
