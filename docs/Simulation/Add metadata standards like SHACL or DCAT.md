# 📘 Water Hydraulic Pressures Simulation in Water Net Pipelines

This document outlines how to simulate hydraulic pressure in water pipe networks and build a complete system that overcomes the current limitations of tools like EPANET and WNTR. We'll build everything needed step-by-step, including live dashboards, real-time data pipelines, ML anomaly detection, multilingual metadata, graph-based querying, a real-time alerting engine, GIS map integration, Streamlit dashboards, exporting to Neo4j or RDF, automated optimization for pump scheduling, exporting results to PDF or Excel, AI-based prediction, a multilingual public-facing web portal, and metadata support using SHACL and DCAT.

## ✅ Project Goals
- Fully simulate water pressure and detect defective pipes.
- Enhance open tools (EPANET, WNTR) with real-time, intelligent capabilities.
- Build modular systems using Docker, PostgreSQL, Python, and Gremlin.
- Visualize data using HTML dashboards and graph UIs.
- Create multilingual, optimized, and extensible water network models.
- Receive real-time alerts for abnormal pressure values or leaks.
- Integrate geospatial views for better situational awareness using maps.
- Create intuitive Streamlit dashboards for non-technical users.
- Export data to graph databases or semantic web standards (Neo4j, RDF).
- Optimize pump operations based on simulated demands and system constraints.
- Generate sharable reports in PDF and Excel formats.
- Forecast future water demand and pressure using AI.
- Build a multilingual and mobile-friendly public-facing web portal.
- Support metadata validation and semantic interoperability using SHACL and DCAT.

## 🌐 Step 13: Multilingual Public-Facing Web Portal

To provide city officials, operators, and the public with an accessible dashboard, we deploy a multilingual web portal that:
- Displays live simulation updates and forecasts
- Supports Arabic, English, and more
- Allows secure data access via role-based logins
- Is mobile-optimized for field engineers

### 🧱 Portal Tech Overview
- **Frontend**: Next.js or Flask + Jinja2 templates (with `i18n` and responsive layout)
- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI for API endpoints and access to PostgreSQL/Gremlin
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens or OAuth2
- **Languages**: English (LTR), Arabic (RTL), French, etc.
- **Data Sources**: PostgreSQL (live pressure), Gremlin (graph), Pandas/Excel (historical)

### 📂 Example Folder Structure
```
webportal/
├── backend/
│   └── api.py
├── frontend/
│   ├── templates/
│   ├── static/
│   ├── i18n/
│   └── app.py (Flask or FastAPI)
├── config/
│   └── settings.py
├── translations/
│   └── ar.json, en.json, fr.json
```

### 📄 Example Web Component (Flask + Jinja)
```html
<h2>{{ _('Pressure at Node') }}: {{ node_name }}</h2>
<p>{{ _('Current Pressure') }}: {{ pressure }} m</p>
```

### 🌍 Language Switching Example
```python
from flask_babel import Babel
app = Flask(__name__)
babel = Babel(app)
@babel.localeselector
def get_locale():
    return request.args.get('lang') or 'en'
```

This enables right-to-left layout, proper translation, and accurate rendering in Arabic or other languages.

## 🧬 Step 14: Metadata Standards (SHACL / DCAT)

To ensure interoperability, traceability, and compliance with semantic web standards, we implement metadata modeling and validation using SHACL and DCAT.

### 📘 What is SHACL?
SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) allows us to define rules for RDF graphs, ensuring that metadata like node pressure, link attributes, or pump types adhere to expected schemas.

### 🔍 What is DCAT?
DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary) helps describe datasets, their sources, formats, and access endpoints in a standard format. Useful for exposing simulation and forecast data to external stakeholders.

### 🧪 SHACL Example (pressure shape)
```ttl
ex:PressureShape
  a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass ex:Node ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path ex:pressure ;
    sh:datatype xsd:decimal ;
    sh:minInclusive 0 ;
    sh:maxInclusive 150 ;
  ] .
```

### 📦 DCAT Dataset Example
```ttl
ex:SimResults a dcat:Dataset ;
  dct:title "Water Pressure Simulation Results"@en ;
  dct:language "en" ;
  dcat:distribution [
    a dcat:Distribution ;
    dcat:accessURL <https://water.example.org/simresults.csv> ;
    dcat:mediaType "text/csv" ;
  ] .
```

These standards improve interoperability across platforms like CKAN, GeoNode, or governmental open data portals.
