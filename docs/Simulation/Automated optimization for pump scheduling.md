# 📘 Water Hydraulic Pressures Simulation in Water Net Pipelines

This document outlines how to simulate hydraulic pressure in water pipe networks and build a complete system that overcomes the current limitations of tools like EPANET and WNTR. We'll build everything needed step-by-step, including live dashboards, real-time data pipelines, ML anomaly detection, multilingual metadata, graph-based querying, a real-time alerting engine, GIS map integration, Streamlit dashboards, exporting to Neo4j or RDF, and automated optimization for pump scheduling.

## ✅ Project Goals
- Fully simulate water pressure and detect defective pipes.
- Enhance open tools (EPANET, WNTR) with real-time, intelligent capabilities.
- Build modular systems using Docker, PostgreSQL, Python, and Gremlin.
- Visualize data using HTML dashboards and graph UIs.
- Create multilingual, optimized, and extensible water network models.
- Receive real-time alerts for abnormal pressure values or leaks.
- Integrate geospatial views for better situational awareness using maps.
- Create intuitive Streamlit dashboards for non-technical users.
- Export data to graph databases or semantic web standards (Neo4j, RDF).
- Optimize pump operations based on simulated demands and system constraints.

## 🎯 Step 10: Automated Optimization for Pump Scheduling

To reduce energy consumption and maintain pressure stability, we integrate optimization algorithms to suggest optimal pump schedules.

### 🔢 Objective
Minimize total energy usage while ensuring:
- Minimum required pressure at all demand nodes
- Maximum pressure not exceeded
- Pumps operate within duty cycle and flow rate limits

### 🧠 Optimization Script (Using PuLP)
```python
from pulp import LpProblem, LpMinimize, LpVariable, lpSum
import numpy as np

# Time periods and pump definitions
time_steps = range(24)  # 24-hour window
pump_ids = ["P1", "P2"]
cost_per_kwh = {"P1": 0.2, "P2": 0.3}

demand_profile = np.random.uniform(0.8, 1.5, len(time_steps))
pump_efficiency = {"P1": 0.75, "P2": 0.85}
max_flow = {"P1": 200, "P2": 250}  # cubic meters per hour

# Variables
flow = {(p, t): LpVariable(f"flow_{p}_{t}", 0, max_flow[p]) for p in pump_ids for t in time_steps}

# Problem
prob = LpProblem("PumpSchedulingOptimization", LpMinimize)

# Objective: Minimize total cost
prob += lpSum([
    (flow[p, t] / pump_efficiency[p]) * cost_per_kwh[p]
    for p in pump_ids for t in time_steps
])

# Constraint: Meet demand per time step
for t in time_steps:
    prob += lpSum([flow[p, t] for p in pump_ids]) >= 400 * demand_profile[t]  # min demand

prob.solve()

# Output schedule
for p in pump_ids:
    for t in time_steps:
        print(f"Pump {p} at hour {t}: {flow[p, t].varValue:.2f} m3/h")
```

This can be extended to:
- Include tank levels and battery storage
- Consider energy tariffs or peak/off-peak prices
- Visualize schedule in Streamlit or Dash
