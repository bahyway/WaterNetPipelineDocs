# 📘 Water Hydraulic Pressures Simulation in Water Net Pipelines

This document outlines how to simulate hydraulic pressure in water pipe networks and build a complete system that overcomes the current limitations of tools like EPANET and WNTR. We'll build everything needed step-by-step, including live dashboards, real-time data pipelines, ML anomaly detection, multilingual metadata, graph-based querying, a real-time alerting engine, GIS map integration, Streamlit dashboards, exporting to Neo4j or RDF, automated optimization for pump scheduling, and exporting results to PDF or Excel.

## ✅ Project Goals
- Fully simulate water pressure and detect defective pipes.
- Enhance open tools (EPANET, WNTR) with real-time, intelligent capabilities.
- Build modular systems using Docker, PostgreSQL, Python, and Gremlin.
- Visualize data using HTML dashboards and graph UIs.
- Create multilingual, optimized, and extensible water network models.
- Receive real-time alerts for abnormal pressure values or leaks.
- Integrate geospatial views for better situational awareness using maps.
- Create intuitive Streamlit dashboards for non-technical users.
- Export data to graph databases or semantic web standards (Neo4j, RDF).
- Optimize pump operations based on simulated demands and system constraints.
- Generate sharable reports in PDF and Excel formats.

## 📁 Step 11: Save/Export Reports in PDF or Excel

Once simulations and optimization are completed, we can export results into professional reports.

### 📊 Export to Excel (openpyxl or pandas)
```python
import pandas as pd
results = pd.DataFrame({
    "Time": range(24),
    "Pump1_Flow": [flow["P1", t].varValue for t in range(24)],
    "Pump2_Flow": [flow["P2", t].varValue for t in range(24)]
})
results.to_excel("pump_schedule.xlsx", index=False)
```

### 📄 Export to PDF (using FPDF)
```python
from fpdf import FPDF

pdf = FPDF()
pdf.add_page()
pdf.set_font("Arial", size=12)
pdf.cell(200, 10, txt="Pump Scheduling Report", ln=True, align="C")

for index, row in results.iterrows():
    pdf.cell(200, 10, txt=f"Hour {row['Time']}: P1={row['Pump1_Flow']:.1f} m3/h, P2={row['Pump2_Flow']:.1f} m3/h", ln=True)

pdf.output("pump_report.pdf")
```

These reports can be generated automatically after each simulation cycle or saved daily as part of an audit trail.
