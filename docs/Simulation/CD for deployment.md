# üìò Water Hydraulic Pressures Simulation in Water Net Pipelines

This document outlines how to simulate hydraulic pressure in water pipe networks and build a complete system that overcomes the current limitations of tools like EPANET and WNTR. We'll build everything needed step-by-step, including live dashboards, real-time data pipelines, ML anomaly detection, multilingual metadata, graph-based querying, a real-time alerting engine, GIS map integration, Streamlit dashboards, exporting to Neo4j or RDF, automated optimization for pump scheduling, exporting results to PDF or Excel, AI-based prediction, a multilingual public-facing web portal, metadata support using SHACL and DCAT, REST/GraphQL APIs for third-party integration, and automated testing with CI/CD.

## ‚úÖ Project Goals
- Fully simulate water pressure and detect defective pipes.
- Enhance open tools (EPANET, WNTR) with real-time, intelligent capabilities.
- Build modular systems using Docker, PostgreSQL, Python, and Gremlin.
- Visualize data using HTML dashboards and graph UIs.
- Create multilingual, optimized, and extensible water network models.
- Receive real-time alerts for abnormal pressure values or leaks.
- Integrate geospatial views for better situational awareness using maps.
- Create intuitive Streamlit dashboards for non-technical users.
- Export data to graph databases or semantic web standards (Neo4j, RDF).
- Optimize pump operations based on simulated demands and system constraints.
- Generate sharable reports in PDF and Excel formats.
- Forecast future water demand and pressure using AI.
- Build a multilingual and mobile-friendly public-facing web portal.
- Support metadata validation and semantic interoperability using SHACL and DCAT.
- Expose simulation, anomaly, and graph data via REST and GraphQL APIs.
- Ensure reliability and stability with automated testing and CI/CD pipelines.

## üß™ Step 16: Testing & CI/CD for Deployment

To ensure quality, maintainability, and rapid deployment, we integrate testing and CI/CD pipelines.

### ‚úÖ Testing
- Use `pytest` for unit, integration, and API tests.
- Example test for REST endpoint:
```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from api import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_pressure_endpoint():
    response = client.get("/pressure/node_1")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "pressure" in response.json()
```

### üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
name: WaterSim CI/CD
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install pytest
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
```

This pipeline ensures code changes are tested and validated before deployment. Additional steps can be added for Docker image builds, deployments to cloud or staging environments, and version tagging.
